\title{Generate a survey to be used inside a learnr tutorial}
\usage{
survey(items, caption = "Survey", message = "Thank you.")

survey_likert(items, levels, caption = "Survey", message = "Thank you.")
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{Item definitions. See details section.}

\item{caption}{Optional survey caption (defaults to "Survey")}

\item{message}{Optional message to display when survey item was submitted (defaults to "Thank you.")}

\item{levels}{Likert scale levels. Can be a character vector or list. See details section.}
}
\value{
A survey as \code{tutorial_quiz} class list.
}
\description{
Create a survey via \code{survey()} from item definitions passed as nested list \code{items} or use the
helper function \code{survey_likert()} for items with Likert scale answers.
}
\details{
Item definitions \code{items} for \code{survey()} must be a list, where each list element in turn is a
list that defines a survey item. The survey item list must contain a \code{text} key (question text)
and the following optional keys:
\itemize{
\item \code{label} for an item identifier
\item \code{type} for the answer type (one of \verb{"learnr_radio", "learnr_checkbox", "learnr_text", "learnr_numeric"})
\item \code{question_args} as list of optional arguments passed to \code{learnr::question}
\item \code{answer_fn} as answer function (only considered in case of \code{"learnr_numeric"} type)
\item \code{answers} as character vector of answer options (only considered in case of \code{"learnr_radio"} or
\code{"learnr_checkbox"} type).
}

The \code{answers} vector can be named so that the vector names represent the answer option value.

Item definitions \code{items} for \code{survey_likert()} must be a character vector with item questions.
It can be a named vector â€“ in this case the names are taken as labels (identifiers) for the survey items.
The item levels \code{levels} can be a character vector or a list. If it is a character vector, we assume that
\code{levels} defines the same Likert scale levels for \emph{all} survey items. Then this vector represents
the answer options. It can be a named vector, in which case the names represent the answer values.
If no names are given, values from 1 to \code{length(levels)} are generated. If this parameter is a list
it must have the same length as \code{items} and hence represents the answer options \emph{per survey item}.
In this case each list entry must be a (optionally named) character vector.

\examples{
# The following code shows an example code chunk with the four types of
# survey items that can be created with the survey() function: single-choice, multiple-choice,
# numeric input and free text input. The survey items definition must be passed as a nested
# list, where each list entry corresponds to an item.

survey(
    list(
        list(
            text = "Is this just a test?",
            answers = c("Yes", "No")
        ),
        list(
            text = "Here comes a question with labelled answers:",
            answers = c("a" = "Option 1",     #' use named vectors

                        "b" = "Option B",
                        "c" = "Option C"),
            type = "learnr_checkbox"
        ),
        list(
            text = "What's your age?",
            label = "survey-age",    #' you can also set custom labels for questions
            type = "learnr_numeric",
            question_args = list(    #' pass additional options
                min = 18,
                max = 100,
                step = 1
            )
        ),
        list(
            text = "What do you think about this app?",
            label = "survey-comment",
            type = "learnr_text"
        )
    ),
    caption = "Survey",
    message = "Thank you."
)

# The following code shows how to use the survey_likert() function. You pass a (named) character
# vector of questions and, corresponding to each question, a list of answer options:

survey_likert(
    items = c(
        "use_during_lessons" = "We should use such apps more during the lessons.",
        "app_general" = "In general, I find this app ...",
        "recommend" = "I would recommend this app to others."
    ),
    levels = list(
        c("fully disagree", "rather disagree", "neutral", "rather agree", "fully agree"),
        paste0("... ", c("very bad", "rather bad", "mediocre", "rather good", "very good"), "."),
        c("yes", "no", "don't know")
    ),
    caption = "Survey",
    message = "Thank you."
)

# If all items should have the same answer options, you can simplify the levels parameter:

survey_likert(
    items = c(
        "use_during_lessons" = "We should use such apps more during the lessons.",
        "app_general" = "In general, I find this app really good.",
        "recommend" = "I would recommend this app to others."
    ),
    levels = c("fully disagree", "rather disagree", "neutral", "rather agree", "fully agree")
)
